                <p class="home-content">DnD or "Dungeons and Dragons" is a classic role playing game played with pen and paper. 
                Currently in its 5th iteration, Dungeons and Dragons consists of one Dungeon Master 
                narrating and crafting the story of the game and several Player Characters living out roles 
                within the Dungeon Masterâ€™s world. It is easy enough for children to learn, but complex enough 
                to take the most seasoned veterans years to master.</p>

                <h3 class="home-title">Who can play?</h3>
                <p class="home-content"> Dungeons and Dragons can be played and enjoyed by anyone, young or old.
                    However, specific roles must be filled to play a game. One player must take the role of Dungeon
                    Master while the other players must fulfill the roles of Player Characters. So long as you have
                    at least one Player Character and only one Dungeon Master, you can play. (Though the game is more
                    fun with more people!)
