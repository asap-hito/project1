                <h3>The Player Character</h3>
                <p>Most players take on the role of Player Character. They choose the actions of one character 
                    within this world and. through the use of roleplaying dice, determine how successful each action is. 
                    They interact with one another as well as the Dungeon Master to move the story forward and carry out 
                    whatever quests they have set upon.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="player-dm">
                <h3>The Dungeon Master</h3>
                <p>The Dungeon Master, or DM, is responsible for controlling the entire world and every other character
                    in it. They do this by utilizing the Rulebook as well as having an intimate knowledge of the 
                    adventure th Player Characters are embarking in. A great deal of quick thinking and a rigid
                    application of the rules are required by DM's in order to run the game successfully.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="player-wt">
                <h3>Working Together</h3>
                <p>The Player Characters work in concert with one another to accomplish a common goal. That much
                    is obvious. What might not be as obvious, however, is that they also work together with the DM.
                    Nobody is working against anyone else. The DM doesn't win if the Players lose. Everybody wins
                    when everyone else is having a good time. That's what makes this game truly magical.</p>
