                <p class="equipment-text">The rulebook, now known as the Player Guide can be used in concert with the Dungeon
                    Master's Guide, and Monster Manual to help the Dungeon Master guide the game and the
                    players understand the rules.
                </p>
                <p class="equipment-text">Adventures can be purchased, taken from generous creators on
                    countless websites, or even created by the Dungeon Master themself. Either way these are
                    the worlds that the players play in and the general plot that they follow.
                </p>

                <p class="equipment-text">To play the game you need a Character Sheet with special locations
                    to put in your character's stats. This represents how skilled a character is and change as
                    they learn and grow. You may also want to take notes.
                </p>
                <p class="equipment-text">Imagination is key. While this game can be played with large
                    grid-based maps and detailed miniatures, the entirety of the game takes place in the
                    collective imaginations of the Dungeon Master and Player Characters.
                </p>
                <img src="https://i.imgur.com/yLVXIGR.jpeg" class="equipment-image" alt="Roleplaying Dice">
                <p class="equipment-text">These special dice determine everything in the game and include the 
                    common six-sided die, down to a four-sided pyramidal die and up to a twenty-sided die. These 
                    are key to the gameplay itself.
